# Advent of Code 2021

This is my first year doing Advent of Code. I've used Rust in the past lightly for small, professional and hobby projects and decided that this would be a good opportunity to exercise by Rust again. My goals for each challenge is not performance neccesarilly, but to exercise different Rust concepts.
